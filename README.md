# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is a work day scheduler that will use local storage to keep an up to date tracker of my current work day. It is intended to be categorized by hours within the window of 9am-5pm. 
This application updates in real time and will coordinate styles with the current hour to apply the styles associated with past present and future.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
